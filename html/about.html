    <h1>About Our Application</h1>

    <h3>This application was created by people who have also enrolled in a bootcamp to learn or strengthen a new skill.</h3>
    <h3>Our purpose was to create a hub where others who have graduated from - or even just attended - a bootcamp can share their experiences to help others find one that would best suit them.</h3>
    <h2>Stay a while! Check out some reviews, or add your own, and good luck on your bootcamp journey!</h2>
