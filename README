The goal of this app is to allow user to create reviews on coding bootcamps that they have gone through.
This way people are not going to multiple sources to learn about a bootcamp that they want to enjoy, but instead
the reviews are all in one place and easy to sort through. There is also going to be a login system so that users can create
a profile and go back to what they posted and edit or delete reviews. While building this app we used react, react-router-dom, bootstrap, python, and postgres.
A user should be able to go to the submit a review page and post a review from there, which should then be displayed on the home page. They should also
be able to utilize the login and sign up page, which should allow them to access their user profile. Ideally, this app should be functioning in the ways stated above
while also keeping in mind future styling features to make the app look cleaner and more professional.
