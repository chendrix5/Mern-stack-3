The goal of this app is to allow user to create reviews on coding bootcamps that they have gone through.
This way people are not going to multiple sources to learn about a bootcamp that they want to enjoy, but instead
the reviews are all in one place and easy to sort through. There is also going to be a login system so that users can create
a profile and go back to what they posted and edit or delete reviews. While building this app we used react, react-router-dom, bootstrap, python,
node.js, and postgress.
